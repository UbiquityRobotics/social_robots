# social_robots

Welcome, this is the start of the social robots project.  The idea is to implement a robot "face" to interact with people in a
collaborative environment.  The face will consist of a touch screen or similar (phone, tablet) mounted on a pan-tilt base.
For my developement I am using a 3D printed pan-tilt from 'Thingaverse',servos driven by an Arduino, and Raspberry Pi 3 with a touch
screen and Raspicam 2.  For software I am planinng to us ROS Noetic with ROS-Serial for the Arduino, and Pygame for the display. I will load code examples as appropriate.

Here is a link to video of the project so far:
